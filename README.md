# Evidence-Based-Lab-Test-Critical-Value-Discovery-for-ICU-Patients
This is the repo for my final year project. Below is the project description:

Patients in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) are physiologically fragile and unstable, generally have life-threatening conditions, and require close monitoring and rapid therapeutic interventions. They are connected to an array of equipment and monitors, and are carefully attended by the clinical staff. Staggering amounts of data are collected daily on each patient in an ICU: multi-channel waveform data sampled hundreds of times each second, vital sign time series updated each second or minute, alarms and alerts, lab results, imaging results, records of medication and fluid administration, staff notes and more. Petabytes of data are captured daily during care delivery in the ICUs; these data are very valuable resources to generate evidence or to discover new knowledge. In this project, we focus on the lab test results data from ICU patients. Our aim is to determine the evidence-based critical values for various lab tests (such as White Blood Cell Count, Creatinine, Hemoglobin etc). The idea here is to identify an inflection point for lab test values, above which there will a steep increase in adverse outcome.
